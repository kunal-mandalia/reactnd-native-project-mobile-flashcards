# Mobile Flashcards ![CI build status](https://travis-ci.org/kunal-mandalia/reactnd-native-project-mobile-flashcards.svg?branch=master)

Use spaced repetition to help you remember historical dates, formulas, or any subject matter that can be learned via a question-and-answer format. All from the convenience of your phone.

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of React Native including navigation, native APIs (via expo), styling, state management with Redux, and async action handling with thunks. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## Demo
